## üîπ 1. What is a _Trie_?

### Answer

**Trie**, often called a **prefix tree** and named after the term **reTRIEval**, is a tree-like data structure tailored for string operations. Instead of housing data within its nodes, a Trie utilizes its edges to encode information.

### Key Features

- **Fast String Operations**: Tries streamline operations such as search, insert, and delete for strings, offering an edge over arrays and hash tables in specific scenarios.
- **Efficient Prefix Searches**: Their hierarchical structure facilitates easy traversal, making operations like autocomplete and prefix-based searches efficient.
- **Memory Compactness**: While they can be more space-intensive than hash tables for smaller dictionaries, Tries can store large dictionaries compactly, suiting tasks like natural language processing, spell-checking, and IP routing.

### Core Components

#### Trie Nodes

The **root node** doesn't carry a character value but acts as the starting point. Each subsequent **child node** corresponds to a distinct character. Some nodes might denote the end of a string while simultaneously representing characters.

#### Node Pointers

Nodes in the Trie hold references to child nodes. For instance, when dealing with the English alphabet, an array of 26 elements can map characters to respective child nodes.

#### Visual Representation

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insertion, Search, and Deletion: $O(m)$ on average, where $m$ is the length of the word.
  - Prefix Search: $O(p)$, where $p$ is the number of words sharing the prefix.

- **Space Complexity**: Roughly $O(n \cdot \sigma)$, where $n$ is the total word count and $\sigma$ represents the size of the alphabet.

### Code Example: Trie

Here is the Python code:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word_end = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
        
    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_word_end = True
        
    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_word_end

# Usage example
trie = Trie()
for word in ["a", "to", "tea", "ted", "ten", "in", "inn"]:
    trie.insert(word)

print(trie.search("tea"))  # True
print(trie.search("tedd")) # False
```

## üîπ 2. What are _Advantages_ and _Disadvantages_ of a _Trie_?

### Answer

The **trie** is a tree-like data structure optimized for string operations. While it presents distinct advantages, it also comes with specific drawbacks.

### Advantages of the Trie

1. **Efficient String Operations**: The trie achieves $O(m)$ time complexity for standard operations like insert, search, and delete, outpacing many traditional data structures.

2. **Prefix Matching**: Designed for rapid prefix matching, the trie is especially effective in auto-completion and spell-check scenarios.

3. **Memory-Saving for Common Prefixes**: The trie stores shared prefixes only once, which is advantageous for datasets with repeated string beginnings.

4. **Effective with Repetitive Data**: It's ideal for identifying duplicates or repetitions in datasets.

5. **Lexicographical Sorting**: The trie structure allows for easy iteration over data in lexicographic order.

6. **Flexible Alphabet Support**: The trie isn't limited to alphanumeric data and can handle any consistent set of symbols, such as DNA sequences.

### Disadvantages of the Trie

1. **Higher Memory Usage**: Compared to some alternatives, the trie can consume more memory, especially for large datasets, due to its node structure.

2. **Insertion Speed**: Inserting characters individually can make the insertion process slower than bulk data insertion methods.

3. **Cache Inefficiency**: Non-contiguous memory storage of trie nodes might lead to more frequent cache misses.

4. **Implementation Complexity**: Its recursive nature and pointer-based setup can make the trie more intricate to implement than simpler structures.

## üîπ 3. What are some _Practical Application_ of a _Trie_?

### Answer

The **Trie** data structure is effective for tasks related to **exact string matching** and **text auto-completion**. Let's look at it's real-world applications.

### Practical Applications

#### Text Input
- **Auto-Completion**: Predict words as a user types, seen in search bars or messaging apps.
- **Spell Checking**: Quickly identify misspelled words.
- **Recommendation Engines**: Offer suggestions based on user input or previous choices.

#### Data Retrieval
- **String Filtering**: Efficiently find exact matches, useful for profanity filtering or blacklists.
- **Contact Lookups**: Search contact lists using names or numbers faster.

#### Data Analysis
- **Web Crawlers**: Assist in web indexing and data extraction.
- **Pattern Matching**: Used in algorithms like Aho-Corasick and Rabin-Karp for matching patterns, including in DNA sequences.

### Code Example: Trie-Based Auto-Completion

Here is the Python code:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word_end = False

class AutoComplete:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert_word(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_word_end = True

    def search_prefix(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return []
            node = node.children[char]
        return self._get_words_from_node(node, prefix)

    def _get_words_from_node(self, node, prefix):
        results = []
        if node.is_word_end:
            results.append(prefix)
        for char, child_node in node.children.items():
            results.extend(self._get_words_from_node(child_node, prefix + char))
        return results

# Sample Usage:
ac = AutoComplete()
ac.insert_word("apple")
ac.insert_word("app")
ac.insert_word("application")
print(ac.search_prefix("ap"))  # ['app', 'apple', 'application']
```

## üîπ 4. Name some _Trie Implementation_ strategies.

### Answer

To **implement a trie**, various strategies are available:

### Array-based Implementation

In this approach, each **trie node** contains an **array** where each index corresponds to a character of the alphabet.

For example, `0` stands for 'a', `1` for 'b', and so on. While simple to understand, this method can **consume more memory**, especially if many of the array elements are unused.

#### Code Example: Array Implementation

Here is the Python code:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        # Array for 26 letters of the alphabet
        self.children = [None] * 26
        self.isEndOfWord = False

# Initialize the root node
root = TrieNode()
```

### Linked List Approach

Here, each **node** corresponds to a **character**, and the `child` attribute points to the **head** of another linked list, representing the next level of characters.

This approach can **save memory** when the number of child nodes is significantly less than the array size of the previous method.

#### Code Example: Linked List Implementation

Here is the Python code:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self, key=None, value=None, parent=None, prev=None):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.parent, self.prev, self.next = parent, prev, None
        self.child = None

# Initialize the root node
root = TrieNode()
```

### Bitmap Strategy

This technique uses a combination of a **bitmap** and an **array of pointers**. The bitmap determines which characters are present at a given node. The array of pointers then has a size equal to the number of set bits in the bitmap.

While this strategy can significantly **reduce the memory footprint**, it can add complexity to some operations.

### Hybrid Techniques

Merging the strengths of the strategies mentioned above can yield a balanced solution. For instance, one could use a **bitmap** to compress the children array in the **array-based approach** or combine bitmaps with linked lists.

### Best Practices for Modern Applications

- **Leverage Libraries**: There are well-optimized, library-based trie structures that can be advantageous. Using established libraries can streamline the process and enhance efficiency.
- **Optimize Based on Use Case**: The ideal trie configuration will vary based on its intended application.
